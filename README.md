# sentimentanalysis
In this google colab i use twitter sentiment dataset available in kaggle link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140/code . I did not download the dataset. instead i use api to access the data set on kaggle.
google colabe file to see code.
i use logistic regression model to relate the features with certain sentiment. This model provides the clear interpretation of the relation ship between input features and output labels. it calculate the probabilities of the given text on sentiment class.
logistic regression is efficient for large data set and computationally take small time of training on large datasets.
